# PROJECT NAME: GLOBAL-FIREPOWER-ANALYSIS

# Overview
This project involves analyzing the Global Firepower dataset to determine the most powerful countries in the world based on various military and defense attributes.

# Problem Objective
The main objective is to rank countries based on their military capabilities and explore the various attributes that contribute to their rankings.

# Dataset
[GLOBAL FIREPOWER.csv](https://github.com/BendelHybrid/GLOBAL-FIREPOWER-ANALYSIS/files/12480730/GLOBAL.FIREPOWER.csv)

# Tool Used
The data visualization for this project was done using Tableau.

# Key Findings
1. The top 10 most powerful countries according to the dataset are: United States, Russia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, France, United Kingdom, Pakistan, and Brazil.
Among the top 10 countries, the United States has the highest GDP.
2. While the United States leads in the number of helicopters and attack helicopters, Sri Lanka surpasses in terms of aircraft carriers.
3. The United States has the highest number of destroyers and submarines, while China has more navy ships.
4. The defense budgets of the United States, China, and Russia are the highest among the countries.
5. China has the largest number of armed forces, including active, reserved, and paramilitary personnel.

# Recommendations
1. Investigate Sri Lanka's Aircraft Carriers: Further exploration is needed to understand how Sri Lanka managed to have a significantly higher number of aircraft carriers compared to other countries in the dataset. Investigate the reasons behind this anomaly and consider whether it is related to data accuracy or a genuine representation of their military capabilities.

2. Analyze United States' Naval Dominance: Given the United States' lead in the number of helicopters, attack helicopters, destroyers, and submarines, a comprehensive analysis should be conducted to understand the strategic significance of these naval assets. Determine how these assets contribute to their overall military dominance and explore the factors that enable the U.S. to maintain such a strong naval presence.

3. Evaluate China's Armed Forces Capacity: China's substantial number of armed forces, including active, reserved, and paramilitary personnel, is noteworthy. Evaluate the sustainability and effectiveness of maintaining such a large armed forces contingent. Consider the challenges and benefits associated with such a significant investment in personnel and its impact on China's military readiness.

4. Study Defense Budget Allocation: Investigate the allocation of defense budgets among the top-ranking countries. Analyze how these budgets are distributed across different areas of military spending, such as technology development, equipment modernization, personnel training, and infrastructure maintenance. Identify trends in budget allocation that contribute to each country's military capabilities.

5.Explore Factors Driving GDP Correlation: Examine the correlation between a country's military power and its GDP. Identify the factors that drive this relationship, such as economic stability, industrial capacity, technological advancement, and global trade partnerships. Understand how these factors contribute to a country's ability to invest in its military capabilities.

6. Consider Geopolitical Implications: While the analysis focuses on quantitative attributes, it's important to acknowledge the geopolitical implications of military power. Consider how military strength impacts a country's global influence, diplomatic relations, and regional stability. Analyze the role that military capabilities play in shaping international dynamics.

Remember that these recommendations are based on the analysis of available data and may require additional research and expert input to draw more concrete conclusions.
